# Automated-Excel-Report-using-Python

Project Title: Automated Excel Report using Python

Problem: Manual Excel files had missing values and required repeated cleaning before reporting.

Solution: I built a Python automation that reads raw CSV data, removes empty rows, and generates a clean Excel report automatically.

Tools Used:

Python

pandas

Excel

Result: The report is generated in seconds with no manual effort, saving time and reducing errors.
